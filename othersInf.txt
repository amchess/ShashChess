Different profiles:
profile-build -> ShashChess
profile-nnue -> ShashChess nnue with pgo build
nnue -> Stockfish nnue
nnue-learn -> training a completely new net
nnue-gen-sfen-from-original-eval -> training data generation

Network structure:

	nnue_architecture.h
	// include a header that defines the input features and network structure
	//#include "architectures/k-p_256x2-32-32.h"
	//#include "architectures/k-p-cr_256x2-32-32.h"
	//#include "architectures/k-p-cr-ep_256x2-32-32.h"
	#include "architectures/halfkp_256x2-32-32.h"
	//#include "architectures/halfkp-cr-ep_256x2-32-32.h"
	//#include "architectures/halfkp_384x2-32-32.h"

	256->20MB (5 different based on the input to the NN): short time controls
	384->30MB: long time controls
	
	Some others architectures, perhaps better in the future:
	there are even more architecture possible and you can find some in ttak repositity:  https://github.com/tttak/ShashChess
	The uncommented 256MB net is compatible with the current 20MB nets.
For MinGW build, use 7.3.0 and experimental/filesystem (not simple filesystem)
Add CBlas as Curl:
